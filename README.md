## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

Before deploying or using the site, ensure you customize the following:

1.  **Contact Form Action:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * Locate the `<form>` tag within the "Contact Us" section.
    * Replace `action="YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL_HERE"` with your actual [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) endpoint URL.

2.  **Team Social Media Links:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * In the "Our Team" section, update the `href` attributes for all social media links (`<a>` tags with `fab` icons) to point to the correct LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc., profiles for each team member. (Snethemba's LinkedIn is already set as `https://za.linkedin.com/in/spngcobo`).

3.  **Company Document Links:**
    * Open `index.html`.
    * In the new "Company Documents & Resources" section, replace the placeholder `href="#"` for the "Download PDF" and "Read More" buttons with the actual URLs to your business plan, company profile, B-BBEE certificate, and privacy policy documents.

4.  **Placeholder Images:**
    * Replace the `https://via.placeholder.com` URLs for the hero section background and carousel slide backgrounds with your own high-quality, optimized images relevant to each service.

5.  **JavaScript Console Logs (Optional for Production):**
    * Open `script.js`.
    * Once you've confirmed all functionalities are working correctly, you can remove or comment out the `console.log()` statements. These were included for debugging purposes during development.
